# Awesome Activity Prediction: [![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)

A paper list of Activity Prediction and related area resources, inspired by [awesome-computer-vision](https://github.com/jbhuang0604/awesome-computer-vision) and [awesome-action-recognition](https://github.com/jinwchoi/awesome-action-recognition/blob/master/README.md).  

I will summarize the papers from 2017 - 2019. In case of papers from 2019, the code will be updated later.
